The traditional process relied heavily on designers, taking up to 15 minutes per teaser, often under tight news deadlines.\n\n# The Solution\n\nTo address this, we conceptualized and developed **Teaserfly**, a modular and scalable internal tool that automates teaser production using **AI generation, smart text suggestions, and media optimization**. The project was designed to fit seamlessly into existing publishing CMS, streamlining editorial and visual workflows.\n\n### My Role\n\nI played a key role in shaping the **concept, infraestructure, and AI research** behind Teaserfly. I also contributed to the **frontend architecture (React, TypeScript)** and **AI enhancement layer**.\n\n# The Approach\n\nTeaserfly was developed in multiple phases:\n\n- **POC:** Manual MVP via Figma plugin for the Bundesliga vertical teaser.\n- **Alpha:** Web prototype integrating text and image AI features.\n- **Beta:** Expanded for all templates, auto-suggestions using article text.\n\n![User Flow Diagram](/assets/projects/teaserfly/teaserFlyUserFlow.png)\n\n# AI Features\n\n- **Design Automation:** Smart cropping and layout adjustments using Amazon Rekognition.\n- **Headline Optimization:** AI-powered text suggestions for each platform.\n- **Add-on Intelligence:** Automatic inclusion of Ad elements, video tags, and logos.\n- **Image Recommendations:** Sugestion of images based on the context.\n- **Creation Agent – 'Teasy':** An optional assistant that helps editors refine graphics interactively.\n\n# Integration\n\nTeaserfly connects directly with internal publishing tools, ensuring editors can **create, preview, and publish teasers** in one flow:\n- Pushes to **CMS** and **DAM System**.\n- Supports export for third-party platforms (YouTube, Instagram).\n\n<video controls style=\"width: 100%; border-radius: 1rem; margin: 2rem 0;\">\n  <source src=\"/assets/projects/teaserfly/teaserflyDemo.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n</video>\n\n# Results\n\n- **90% reduction** in manual work time (from 15 min to 90 sec per teaser)\n- **Standardized design output** across all formats\n- **AI-powered scalability**, handling hundreds of assets daily\n- **Empowered newsroom teams** to operate independently of design bottlenecks\n\n# Future Vision\n\nTeaserfly continues to evolve with the introduction of **personalization, A/B testing, and dynamic design adaptation** — using real-time performance data and multilingual optimization to push editorial automation even further.\n\nThis is a company project developed internally at Axel Springer GmbH, no public demo or code repository can be shared.",

The production demanded a complete digital control ecosystem built from scratch in just **two weeks** — responsible for managing every part of the game’s mechanics in real time.\n\n![Studio Demo](/assets/projects/quemficaempe/demo.jpg)\n\nThe system needed to integrate seamlessly with **Vizrt broadcast graphics**, synchronize with the presenter’s timing, and guarantee the accurate calculation of prizes — totaling **over R$500,000** in awards across two seasons. According to the show’s Wikipedia page, the premiere significantly **improved Band’s audience ratings** in the São Paulo region.\n\n# The Solution\n\nA fully custom-built, C#-based platform was developed to manage the entire show logic, with three interconnected applications working in real time:\n\n1. **Game Management System** – Proprietary CMS for registering over **3,000 questions**, managing rounds, prizes, and the complete rundown of each episode.\n2. **Vizrt Control Connector** – Real-time TCP socket controller for graphics and animations displayed on the studio’s large screen, ensuring frame-perfect sync with Datena’s narration.\n3. **Teleprompter System (TP)** – Interface for presenters and contestants displaying dynamic instructions and timed content during live recording.\n\n ![SystemScreen](/assets/projects/quemficaempe/tela1.png)\n\n# My Role\n\nI designed the system’s architecture, coded every module, and developed **custom connectors for Vizrt integration**. My responsibilities included:\n\n- Building the CMS and control interfaces\n- Implementing the scoring and prize logic\n- Managing TCP socket communication between systems\n- Supporting live studio operations throughout the first season\n\n# The Approach\n\nDevelopment was fast-paced and highly collaborative. I worked closely with the **engineering, art, and direction teams** to align visual and technical workflows. The system’s architecture combined **C#**, **PostgreSQL**, and **TCP-based real-time control**, delivering a stable, low-latency experience during broadcast.\n\n# Team & Production\n\n- **Program Director:** Pablo Mazover  \n- **Production Coordination:** Eduardo Gaspar  \n- **Art Direction:** Omar Sabbag  \n- **Art Coordination:** Pedro Coelho  \n- **Engineering Coordination:** Thiago Perrela / Carol Garcia  \n\n# Results\n\n- **Full delivery within two weeks** before the live premiere\n- **Zero technical failures** during broadcast\n- **Perfect synchronization** between presenter, visuals, and scoring system\n- **Boosted Band’s audience ratings** in the premiere week\n- Early Brazilian example of **live game automation integrated with broadcast graphics**\n\n<video controls style=\"width: 100%; border-radius: 1rem; margin: 2rem 0;\">\n  <source src=\"/assets/projects/quemficaempe/demo.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n</video>\n\n# Legacy\n\n'Quem Fica em Pé' set a benchmark for **interactive broadcast automation** in Brazilian television, inspiring future projects focused on real-time synchronization and audience engagement.",

Furthermore, strict **compliance and operational safety policies** mandated that no system could interfere with gameplay performance or jeopardize the broadcast, even in case of failure.\n\nThe technical environment posed additional challenges: over **2,000 spectators** in the arena, high electromagnetic interference, and numerous wireless devices caused instability in Bluetooth communications.\n\n# The Solution\n\nWorking as a **freelance systems engineer**, I developed a two-part telemetry pipeline connecting **Zephyr biometric sensors** worn by the ten players to the **Vizrt** graphics system operated by **wTVision**. The goal was to stream real-time physiological data safely into the broadcast layer without impacting the competition.\n\nTwo complementary applications were built in **C#**:\n\n1. **Bluetooth Reader (NUC – Under Stage)**  \n   Installed beneath the main stage, this application handled **Bluetooth pairing, decoding, and data normalization** for all ten players’ Zephyr sensors. It managed signal stability and transmitted readings over **TCP Stream**.\n\n2. **Telemetry Controller (Control Room)**  \n   Running from the control room, it received data via TCP, processed and formatted it in **JSON**, and sent it via **UDP** to **Vizrt**, where graphics were updated live on screen. It also functioned as a monitoring dashboard, allowing real-time tracking of player vitals.\n\n![System Diagram](/assets/projects/riot-telemetry/diagram.jpg)\n\n# My Role\n\nI was responsible for designing and coding both systems end-to-end:\n\n- Built the **Bluetooth decoding layer** for Zephyr sensors.\n- Implemented **TCP/UDP communication middleware** to link stage and control room with minimal latency.\n- Developed a **real-time compliance logic** ensuring that signal loss would never impact gameplay or broadcast continuity.\n- Supported **live operations** throughout the event, troubleshooting Bluetooth instability under high interference.\n\n<video controls style=\"width: 100%; border-radius: 1rem; margin: 2rem 0;\">\n  <source src=\"/assets/projects/riot-telemetry/demo.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n</video>\n\n# The Approach\n\nThe project was executed in **three weeks**, involving close coordination between **Riot Games**, **wTVision**, and the local production crew. The architecture prioritized **redundancy, reliability, and isolation**, ensuring that any sensor or network failure would not affect live performance.\n\nAlthough magnetic noise caused **some instability during the event**, the system remained operational and successfully displayed live biometric data throughout the competition—marking a pioneering moment in Brazilian eSports broadcasting.\n\n# Results\n\n- **First-ever human telemetry integration** in a Brazilian eSports broadcast.\n- **Operational compliance** achieved — no interference with gameplay or broadcast continuity.\n- **Functional real-time data visualization** via Vizrt graphics.\n- **Performance rated as satisfactory** despite expected signal interference.\n- Praised by **Riot Games Brasil** and **wTVision** as an innovative step forward for live eSports production.\n\n![Control Room Screen](/assets/projects/riot-telemetry/screen1.png)",
